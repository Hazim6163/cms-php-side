## on upload profile pic preview:
I create a 2 div inside profile img div the first one was before img selected and the second one is after the image selected then in jquery when the img is selected then preview the image in the second div 'after img selected', display style value to block and the first div 'before img selected' I set the display style value to none

## after select img crop with php and ajax:
for that we will use a custom css and js lib that called croppie that content two files css and js... 
* first create the model that when we select the img will show to the user to crop the img
* inside the modal image view where the image will edited 
* then listen when the image will selected to open the modal
* in the modal on save btn click the edited img will send to the php server to store it temporally and then send the url back to the signup page 
  
you can find the project where the author create the project in the html in the xampp folder
